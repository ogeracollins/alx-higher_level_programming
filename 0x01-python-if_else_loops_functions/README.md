## Introduction

This repository serves as a learning resource for Python loops and functions.

Loops allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code, making them invaluable for performing repetitive tasks. Functions, on the other hand, enable you to encapsulate reusable pieces of code for better organization and modularity.

## Topics Covered

The repository covers a range of topics related to Python loops and functions, including:

- `for` loops
- `while` loops
- Loop control statements (e.g., `break`, `continue`)
- Nested loops
- Function definition and invocation
- Function parameters and return values
- Scope and variable visibility
- Recursion (recursive functions)

## Examples and Exercises

The repository provides numerous examples and exercises to practice ones understanding of Python loops and functions.
