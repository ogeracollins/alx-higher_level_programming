# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: List, Tuples
Welcome to the Python Data Structures: Lists and Tuples repository! This private repository is designed to help you learn about lists and tuples in Python and explore their functionalities.

## Introduction

In Python, lists and tuples are fundamental data structures that allow you to store and manipulate collections of items. Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be modified, added, or removed. Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable, making them suitable for situations where you want to ensure data integrity and prevent accidental modifications.

This repository will guide you through the essential concepts of lists and tuples in Python, covering topics such as creation, indexing, slicing, common operations, and practical applications.
